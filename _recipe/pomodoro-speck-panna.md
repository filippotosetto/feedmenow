ingredients:
  - 500 g of penne
  - 'a thick slice of speck, like 200g'
  - 300 g of tomato sauce
  - 150 g cream
  - half a shallot
  - rock salt
  - parmigiano
preparation:
  - "Now guys to cook pasta you don't need a degree in science, it's pretty damn simple. Take a large pot and fill it with water and put it on the stove until it boils, the amount of water should be at least three or four time the amount of pasta. Once and only once the water is boiling toss in an handful of rock salt, and then the pasta. Keep steering the pasta every two minutes otherwise it stick to the pan. Don't put oil in the water, that's for lazy people, and cooking is not for lazy people.  Now once you reach the time written in the pasta package, taste the pasta and see if it's ready. once you decide it's cooked just empty the pasta in a colander."
  - 'While the pasta is cooking prepare the sauce. Chop the shallot as thin as possible, half a millimeter cubes. - Chop the speck in small cubes as well 2 mm should be perfect.'
  - 'Now add three four spoons of olive oil in a frying pan, let the oil heat up and toss the onion in it. Let it cook for 1 minutes and then add the speck. keep steering for one or two minutes until the fat in the speck started to melt.'
  - At this stage you can pour in the tomato sauce and the cream. Stir until you create a pinky creamy sauce. Cook for 10 minutes a really low heat.
  - 'Once the pasta is ready to go, pour it from the colander to the frying pan where the sauce is. Remember to turn off the stove. now steer slowly the sauce sticks to the pasta.'
comment: 'And off you go, serve it whit as much grated parmiggiano as you want.'
