ingredients:
  - 1 Kg of potatoes
  - 300 g of flower
  - 1 egg
  - pinch of salt
preparation:
  - "Let's start by boiling the potatoes. Put the potatoes in a very large pan and cover them completely with water. Count 30-40 minutes from when the water start to actually boil. To be sure the potatoes are properly cooked, try to pierce them with a fork, you want the fork to slide in without any effort. Once they are cooked take them out from the water and peel them while they are still hot."
  - 'Now wait a bit for the potatoes to cool down and then mash them completely; add the flower, the egg and a pinch of salt. Knead all the ingredients together until you for a fluffy but solid dough.'
  - "With the dough now ready use your fingers to create few long 'worms' with 2-3 cm diameter. Now with a knife cut the 'worms' in small pieces to actually create your gnocchi. You should use flower to keep your hands and the table completely dry, otherwise the dough will stick everywhere."
  - "Once the gnocchi are ready you can cook them. The process is quite simple, fill a large saucepan with water, put it on the fire. Once it's boiling slowly trow in the gnocchi one by one. Leave them there for few minutes, until they start to float on the surface, then with a slotted spoon take them out from the water."
comment: 'You can use different sauces for the gnocchi, the traditional one is obviously with tomato sauce and parmigiano cheese.'
