# Ingredients
- eggs
- flour

# Preparation
1 - Clean up your kitchen table and create a sort of vulcano shape with the flower. Break inside the eggs, one at the time and slowly mix it with the flower using a fork. Once the flower is well mixed with all the eggs and you can't use the fork anymore to steer the dough start to use your hands.  Manipulate the dough until it gets firm and create a nice ball with it.  Wrap it in cling film and put it in the fridge for an hour or so.

2 - Prepare the pasta maker machine on the side of the table. Take the dough out of the fridge and start to cut it in 2cm slices. Set the machine to the highest number and pass the slices of dough trough it. At every pass go down one number until you reach the thickness you want.

3 - Once a sheet of pasta is ready, sprincle it with flour and set it a side. Don't stack the sheets on top of the other otherwise they stick together.

You can use the pasta sheets to do tortellini or tagliatelle.
