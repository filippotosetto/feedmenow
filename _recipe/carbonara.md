ingredients:
  - '500 g of spaghetti (or penne, I love them both)'
  - 5 eggs
  - 150 g of pancetta cubes
  - half a shallot
  - rock salt
  - pepper
  - parmigiano
preparation:
  - "Now guys to cook pasta you don't need a degree in science, it's pretty damn simple. Take a large pot and fill it with water and put it on the stove until it boils, the amount of water should be at least three or four time the amount of pasta. Once and only once the water is boiling toss in an handful of rock salt, and then the pasta. Keep steering the pasta every two minutes otherwise it stick to the pan. Don't put oil in the water, that's for lazy people, and cooking is not for lazy people.  Now once you rich the time written in the pasta package, taste the pasta and see if it's ready. once you decide it's cooked just empty the pasta in a colander."
  - "While the pasta is cooking prepare the sauce. Chop the shallot as thin as possible, like 1mm is already too much. Three four spoons of olive oil in a frying pan, let the oil heat up and toss the onion in it. Let it cook for 1 minutes and then add the pancetta. keep steering the pancetta until it gets almost crispy, not burned please. once it's ready remove it from the heat."
  - 'Now the eggs, break four of the eggs in a bowl paying attention to get rid of the white, then add the last egg as a whole. whisk the eggs until you start to see bubbles. add pinch of pepper and a good handful of grated parmigiano. whisk a bit more.'
  - 'So once the pasta is ready to go, pour it from the colander to the frying pan where the pancetta is, then add the eggs. Remember to turn off the eat otherwise the eggs cook too much. now steer slowly the pasta until the eggs are slightly cooked but still creamy.'
comment: 'And off you go, serve it whit a bit more pepper and as much grated parmiggiano as you want.'
