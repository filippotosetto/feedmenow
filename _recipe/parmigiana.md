# Ingredients
- 1.5 Kg of aubergines
- 500 g of mozzarella
- 150 g of parmigiano
- 50 g of pecorino (if you can find it otherwise make 200g of parmigiano)
- 1kg tomato sauce
- 1 middle white onion, or a shallot that is much better
- Fresh basil
- Rock salt
- Olive oil
- Frying oil (sunflower or whatever you can find)

# Preparation
1 - First thing first slice the aubergine, with a slicer if you can, they should be 1cm thick. Place them on a big plate, creating layers if you can, and sprinkle rock salt on top of each layer. Leave them a side for an hour or so. The salt will let the aubergines sweat out a bit of water that make them bitter.

2 - While the aubergines are sweating prepare the tomato sauce. Chop the onion/shallot as thin as you can. The thinner the better as they will melt in the sauce. Now in a tall pan put three or four spoons of olive oil and let it heat up. After 30 seconds place toss in the onion, keep steering them with a wooden spoon every 20 seconds and so. Once they are golden add the tomato sauce and the basil leaves. If you break the basil leaves with your hands instead of using a knife is even better, oh the smell that they produce.  Reduce the heat to the minimum and let the sauce simmer there while you prepare the rest.

3 - Now the cheese. Grate both the parmigiano and the pecorino and mix them together in a bow. Than slice the mozzarella with a knife, I know it's hard to get decent slices, but try to get them down to 1 or 2 cm max.

4 - Frying time! Put 1 to 2 finger of frying oil in a pan. While it's heating up, get rid of the water the aubergines produced and dry each one of them with kitchen paper. To check if the oil is ready, take a small piece of aubergine and gently place it in the oil, if the oil start to bubble you are ready to go. So now you need to fry each slice of aubergine individually. Please don't toss all of them in the pan, just be patient and fry each one of them. I don't really have a way to check when they are ready, well for sure you should avoid to burn them or get them crispy. I would say they should be still nice and soft. Once a slice is ready place it in kitchen paper to get rid of the oil in excess.

5 - Finally the fun part. In an oven trey start to place one layer of aubergines, one of tomato sauce, one of mozzarella and sprinkled parmiggiano, and start again from the aubergines. Go on until you finish all the ingredients. Usually I manage 3 or 4 levels. Important part is to finish with the mozzarella and a looooot of cheese.  And now put the whole thing in the oven for 30 min at 180 degrees.

6 - Take it off from the oven and dig in!

Best thing about the parmigiana is that you can keep it in the fridge for few days. You can eat it warm or cold, it doesn't mater, it's delicious anyway.
